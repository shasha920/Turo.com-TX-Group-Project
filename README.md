*GBA 5140 Statistics Essentials for Business Analytics<br>*
*Turo Project Description<br>*
*team captain: Hua Yang<br>*
*team member: liwu Dong, Yi Wei, Yiwen Huang<br>*
*Purpose<br>*
*This project provides hands-on experience of working with real-world data collected from a popular peer-to-peer online car sharing platform. Using statistics knowledge and R programming skills you learned from this course, you will explore and clean the dataset, build multiple linear regression models, interpret the results, discuss business insights, and document the whole process and your conclusion in the form of a report. Data
This dataset was collected from a popular car sharing website Turo.com. See examples of website at the end of this document.<br>*
*Read dataset “turo.data.5140” into RStudio using “readRDS” function (note it is not in csv format).<br>*
*Briefly<br>*
*1.	Load the data into RStudio. (contribute:Hua Yang)<br>*
*2.	Extract all the observations from the state your group is assigned to, and use this subset for the following tasks. (contribute:Hua Yang)<br>*
*3.	Compute summary statistics (exclude missing values by setting na.rm = TRUE) and generate charts for ALL variables in the dataset. For each continuous variable, compute min, first quartile, medium, third quartile, max, mean, standard deviation, and skewness as summary statistics, and draw histogram. For each categorical variable, compute frequency and relative frequency distributions, and draw bar chart. (contribute:Hua Yang)<br>*
*4.	Use Inter Quartile Range (IQR) method to identify outliers of all continuous variables, then remove all observations containing outliers. (contribute:Liwu Dong, Yi Wei, Yiwen Huang）<br>*
*5.	Remove all observations with missing values. (contribute:Liwu Dong, Yi Wei, Yiwen Huang）<br>*
*6.	Build a multiple linear regression model using car.trip.price as dependent variable. Select at least five independent variables. Treat each categorical variable as a single variable although it may be broken into multiple dummy variables. Try different models and choose the best one you can find:<br>*
